  <h2><p>
    Though a Marylander by birth, I am proud to call the Queen City (Charlotte, NC) home. I've been in finance for the last decade as both a registered Representative
    and as a registered principal. I decided to expand my education with an MBA from UNC Charlotte, where I matriculated in 2018. I've continued my education
    by learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It's an ongoing journey, and I expect to add more web development tools to my belt in my quest to become a full stack
    developer.

    <p>In my personal life, I have an eclectic mix of hobbies and interests. As might be guessed from the background on this page, I am passionate about all things coffee.
    I roast it, I grind it, I brew it in a number of different ways, and I'm a complete sucker for local cafes. I'm a fan of the outdoors and enjoy frequenting Charlotte's
    US National Whitewater center to bike, run the trails, or glide through the sky on a zipline. I also love traveling and seeing what the far reaches and more local corners
    of the world have to teach me.</p><p>
      Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to drop me a note!</p>
